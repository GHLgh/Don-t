* Implemented collision between objects, what will affect to the status of the objects if they collide, except collision detection.

#Week 2
* Used Matter.js as physic library instead of using home made one
* Implemented collision detection
* Implemented game event and event trigger based on collision detection
* Added camera tracking such that the map can be expended beyond the screen

#Week 3
